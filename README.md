# DevelopingDataProducts

This shiny app uses the Chatterjeeâ€“Price Attitude Data, which is part of the R package 'datasets'. 

As a user you can choose how many department answers you'd like to include in the plots (there are 30 in total), and which parameter in particular you'd like to see a separate plot of.

You can use the slider to choose the number of department answers, and the dropdown to choose a particular parameter.

The first plot shows the pairs relationships for all parameteres, and it uses as many data points as you've indicated through the slider. 

The second plot displays only if the users chooses a parameter.
